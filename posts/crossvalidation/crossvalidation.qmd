## Cross validation

Hello today I am going to talk about cross validation.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(caret)

mydata <- ISLR2::Portfolio

set.seed(1234)
control_kfold <- trainControl(method = "cv", number=10)


kfold <-train(Y~X , data = mydata, method = "lm", trControl = control_kfold)

kfold$results

```

This is not the best sample. But gets you the basics for the cross-validation. The training data is divided into 10 folds. Every time the model is created with 9 folds, one of the folds is left out to estimate the validation of the model. Once the model is created, you can validate your results with the model\$results. In this case kfold\$results.
