This is a post with executable code.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(ISLR2)

mydata <- ISLR2::Portfolio

model <- lm(Y~X, data=mydata)

summary(model)
```

We can see that the X variable is significant. Notice the three start to the right.

Let's now plot the relation between these two variables.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

plot(mydata$X,mydata$Y)

```

There is a positive correlation between Y, the dependent variable, and X, the independent variable.

Now let's evaluate if the model is a valid model

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(tidyverse)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(model)

```

First, we call the library tidyverse which has this plot command to evaluate the feasibility of our model.

The top right graph shows that the residuals vs fitted values are randomly distributed, with a minimal deviation from the horizontal line.

The next graph to the right is the Q-Q plot. Q_Q plot checks the linearity of the data. If the points are all close to the line that is a good validation of the model.

The other two graphs will show and highlight the outliers and high-leverage points.
