### ***Classification of potential Donors and prediction of Gift Amount:***


begin{left}We have been approached by a non-profit organization to build a classification and predictive model that will be used to increase the cost-effectiveness of their current direct marketing campaign. The organization has provided data with a historical background to its direct marketing campaign. Personalized address mailers are sent out to previous donors for \$2.00; the average donation gift amount is \$14.50 from respondents. However, the campaign is operating at a loss due to low donation rates of 10%. The organization would like for us to take a provided dataset of prior donors to create our analytical models in order to make their direct marketing campaign not operate at a loss.

We assess the potential profit of our study by using the adjusted confusion matrix from the ensemble classification model with the average donation amount from the AutoNeural validation model to calculate various profit-losses, considering with and without opportunity costs. We will then use the percentages of the adjusted confusion matrix to estimate the profit or loss generated by the score data results. We will also consider the lift provided by the score data.

The resulting profit from our model, based on the validation classification data with the score donation value, was \$1,695.65. We ignore the opportunity cost from false negatives in our profit evaluation.

### ***Forecast model to predict the demand of Covit-19 vaccine***

According to the World Health Organization, Covid-19 is an infectious disease that cause symptoms such as fever, cough, tiredness, and loss of taste or smell. The World Health Organization stated that anyone can get sick with the virus and become extremely sick or die at any age. Covid-19 outbreak goes back to late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China as mentioned by (Wu et al., 2020). Moreover, (Ybarra, 2022) added that some Covid-19 cases suffer from something called long-term Covid which means some Covid-19 symptoms affect parts of the body such as the lungs, causing trouble in breathing, harsh cough, and shortness of breath. More than a year ago, a vaccine was derived against the Covid-19 virus. 4.4 billion people have had one or more doses, which represents 56% of the world's population (Mallapaty et al., 2021). In this project, we will study the vaccination process in California and try to predict the booster-eligible population in all California counties.

I worked on a model to calculate the demand for vaccines in the state of California. Two models were presented aggregating the data in monthly buckets with 12-month lags as independent variables. In the second model, the data was aggregated in weekly buckets with 4-week lags as independent variables. The data was split into two datasets without breaking the sequence of the dataset, training with 65% of the data and testing with 35% of the remaining values in the dataset. The model was trained using a linear regression algorithm.

I recommended the model with weekly buckets to provide accurate predictions of future demand.

### ***Salaries, Foreign born vs Native in Texas.***

In this project, we evaluate the attributes that influence a worker's salary in Texas. We proceed with analytics of the data including data exploration and data cleansing.

Deep understanding of SCOR model, Lean six-sigma DMAIC methodology, costing/forecasting, process mapping, profitability analysis tools, supply chains, and operations planning. The main attributes evaluated were place of birth, jobs, occupations, income,sex, and educational attainment. For this project we used Google Big Query, Python linear regression, and decision tree in SAS.

The best salary among the four males was predicted for a foreign male with a graduate degree who runs his own business.
